## Project Purpose

**Holy Tools** is a demonstrational set of tools assembled for learning and researching network behavior and defensive mechanisms. The project is intended only for:

- understanding how network protocols work;  
- creating isolated labs for testing and debugging;  
- studying detection methods and defenses against network attacks (for research/educational purposes).

By downloading this repository you confirm that you will use it only in authorized, isolated environments (virtual machines, test networks, lab environments).

## Features (overview)

> Descriptions are high-level â€” no operational instructions provided.

- **pcap_sniff** â€” a demonstration of capturing and analyzing network traffic (used to study packet formats and structure).  
- **syn_flood** â€” a demonstrational implementation of a technique referenced in DoS analysis (intended only for test networks).
- **arp_spoffing** â€” 100% WiFi connection disruption (intended only for test networks).
- **Soon again...**

## Safety & Usage Recommendations

1. **Use only in isolated labs.** We recommend running these tools in virtual machines and/or on physically separate networks that are not connected to production infrastructure.  
2. **Obtain permission.** Before testing any system, ensure you have written authorization from the system owner.  
3. **Do no harm.** Do not attempt to use these tools against public services, work networks, or other people's devices.  
4. **Use for defense and research.** Use the materials to learn how to detect and mitigate threats, not to exploit them.
